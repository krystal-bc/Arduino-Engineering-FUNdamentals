# Arduino-Engineering-FUNdamentals

This series of programs is for a summer community extension class for kids at East Los Angeles College.

Day 1 - Blink and Blink Augmented
Blink: makes an LED blink at adjustable intervals and is provided as example code in the Arduino IDE. 
Blink Augmented: does the same but is set up for 3 LEDs instead of 1 

Day 2 - Servo Potentiometer
allows the angle of a positional rotation servo (0 to 180 deg range) to be controlled by a potentiometer and prints their values on the Serial Monitor accessible through the IDE.

Day 3 - RGB LED
uses 'for' loops to transition colors an RGB LED

Day 4 - Servo Routine
controls 2 continuous rotation servos mounted on a chassis from a Parallax Boe-Bot in a search pattern that will be used in Day 5.

Day 5 - Obstacle Avoiding Robot
uses 2 continuous rotation servos, a 4-pin ultrasonic sensor, and an LED, all mounted on a chassis from a Parallax Boe-Bot (but use an Arduino uno microcontroller, rather than BASIC Stamp). This robot will avoid obstacles and the LED will light up when it detects an obstruction.
